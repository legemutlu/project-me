# Hi Fellas! üëãüèΩ

In this post, you'll learn how to create an angular docker container.

This post divided into as following parts:

  - Create Angular App
  - Create Dist Folder
  - Create Dockerfile
  - Build Docker and run

----
# So, First We Need Angular Application

I'm going to create an Angular Application, and first we have to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) which is Javascript Runtime Environment.

We need [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started) (Node Package Manager). npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. We‚Äôll use npm to install packages or libraries.

Then, we‚Äôll generate a new Angular project using the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli). Install it globally (with the -g flag) in your command line :

```js
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Now, we can create an Angular Application in the command line, my project name is angular-docker, and you are free for pick a name whatever you want

Using ```ng new``` command create application :

```js
ng new angular-docker
```

After creating Angular Application, we go through project folder and run application :

```js
ng serve
```

When you see the message in your command line '‚úÖ Compiled successfully' then check the url which is ```http://localhost:4200/```.

You will see this default welcome page :

We got a working angular application right now.

First part of post is done fellas!! üí™üèΩ

# Let's Create a Dist Folder

The first thing to do is to build the application and dist folder will be created.
In Angular, this is just as simple as running the following command :

```js
ng build --prod
```

When the dist folder created, you can see inside the dist folder static files.
These files are everything you need to show your application to the outside world.

If you haven't struggled about first and that part, we can continue with third part of post.

# Create Dockerfile

First start create a Dockerfile in route directory of project.


We create a layer from the node:latest Docker image with ```FROM```.
> I use node latest version, you can use node specific version as node:16.13.0

```dockerfile
FROM node:latest as node
```

Bundled everything inside an application folder which is called app.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

Copy package.json and package-lock.json files of our local application folder toward this app folder inside the Docker container.
And run npm install.

```dockerfile
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
```

Copy every file.

```dockerfile
COPY . .
```

And build our project.


```dockerfile
RUN npm run build --prod
```

Alpine is the base image which is based on Alpine Linux. So, node:alpine is an Alpine Linux image with node the latest version installed.

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=node /app/dist/eshopz usr/share/nginx/html
```

All Dockerfile instructions becomes like this :

```dockerfile
FROM node:16.13.0 as node
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build --prod

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=node /app/dist/eshopz usr/share/nginx/html
```

----

# And Finally Build Docker and Run

So, let‚Äôs build and run the application with the Docker command angular-docker:

```js
docker build -t angular-docker .
docker run -d -p 4200:80 angular-docker
```

üí• Let's check ```http://localhost:4200/``` and will see running application. That's sort of magic and docker.

-----

# So, that's all folks. We got application that is working in docker container. Good luck with that!ü§üüèæ
